# Water-Pollution-Visualization-in-City-Cluster
An environmental modeling &amp; monitoring project that visualizes the water quality within Greater Bay Area city cluster, China

Overview:

-Background: This project aimed to visualize the water pollution (organic pollution and sand turbidity) level and evaluate water quality in the Pearl River Delta City Agglomeration.

-Highlights: Implemented a remote sensing modeling technique using PCI Geomatica V9.0 and EASI scripting for processing and analyzing a TM satellite imagery.

-Skills & Tools Used: PCI Geomatica V9.0, EASI scripting, image preprocessing, and remote sensing inversion and visualization.

-Analysis Methods: radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, water-land separation, and denoising processes.


Workflow:
Process Steps:
1. Radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction for surface reflectance conversion.
2. Separation of water and land for water body analysis.
3. Inversion of remote sensing data for organic pollution and turbidity analysis.
4. Employed median and mean filtering for enhanced result clarity.
5. Density segmentation for the visual representation of pollution levels.
